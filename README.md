# blackjack-terminal
A primitive BlackJack game on the terminal. Since it is on the Terminal, the whole game is played displayed using ASCII characters. Controls are similar to text-adventure games, where the scenario will be set and the player will be asked to perform a certain action by selecting an option from a given set of choices. 

To run, open a terminal in the project directory and type the following to start the game: python3 start.py
